Maize rendering code is provided as an example and to aid repeatability, but is not intended for broad reuse without extensive modification.

Depends on Blender

batchscript.py 

Batchscript reads in a set of 3D meshes of plants in 3DS format, and a set of background scenes, camera angles, and lighting in blender format, and farms each combination out to be rendered into a 2D image in Blender using Blender's command line python scripting API.

Reconfiguration requires:

1) modifying line 4 to point to a directory containing 3DS formated mesh models of plants created by Plant Factory Exporter.
2) Modifying line 10 to parse the naming format used for these 3DS images and define mynum as a string with the unique identifier portion of each name.
3) Modifying line 11 to loop a number of times equal to the number of distinct camera angles being simulated.
4) Modifying lines 13 and 15 to point to a director with one .blend formated 3D scene (including background objects, camera, and lighting position) for each angle.
5) Also modifying "render_script_v3.py" (see belwo.

render_script_v3.py

render_script_v3 is run within Blender's command line python API. It depends on a set of variables in a configuration file written by batchscript.py and is not intended to be run independently. 

Reconfiguration requires:


Define the range of color space that plant tissue should appear by modifying lines 28-37 to define colors in the HSV colorspace. 
Lines 28, 31, 35 define centers and standard deviations for hue, saturation, and value respectively. 
Lines 29-30, 32-33, and 36-37 define absolute limits for hue, saturation, and value respectively. 

Line 52 can be modified to grow or shrink the original 3D plant model on the x, y, and z axes. 

Line 98 must be modified to point to the directory where the user wishes the new 2D renders to be saved.
